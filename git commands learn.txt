two types 
1.working dir (local)
2.remote (github)
3. fetch  == is a way to get changes from remote to local but it dont fetch the files after fatch you have to use git marge to marge the changes 
4.git pull ==pulls the all files from remote to local and also merge with my local files and also add the changes means fetch and push at the same time 
5.git push  == push local files to remote  
//
git push -u origin master
In the code, the origin is your default remote repository name 
and '-u' flag is upstream, which is equivalent to '-set-upstream.' 
and the master is the branch, name.upstream is the repository that we have cloned the project.
//

1. after changing file and etc in our local we need to stage files 
and then 

2. local repository (creat)
3. then we can push to remote

11.  git reset --hard                              == to reset to local and get back deleted raw file also with changes

18. git diff
19. git pull-request

3. Make a new branch.

You can create a new branch by using the git checkout -b 'branch_name'. In the above code, '-b' flag is used to create a new branch, and 'branch_name' is used to give the branch a specific name, and with checkout, the branch is switched to the newly created branch.
